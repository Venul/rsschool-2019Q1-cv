# Summary 
The last 4 years my main activity is frontend development. To create responsive cross-browser pages, I mainly use HTML5 and CSS3 (Bootstrap, Semantic Ui, Sass), as well as JavaScript. Have experience developing on such JS frameworks as Vue and ExtJS. In the direction of the frontend, familiar with the template engine Twig, MJML to create email, WordPress. In addition to the frontend, there is experience with backend, like the symfony framework (PHP) and databases (Oracle, MS SQL). I was writing e2e tests for NightmareJS (Mocha, Chai) and Unit tests (PHPUnit). In large projects I use Git, the development environment is Ubuntu.  
Seeking employment with a company where I could apply and improve my programming skills and take all the advantages of my knowledge
